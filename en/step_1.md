Coordinates in p5 start from an <span style="color: #0faeb0; font-weight: bold;"> origin point (0,0) </span> in the top-left of the screen. This top-left positioning of x = 0 and y = 0 is commonly used when programming apps and games. If you have used Scratch or plotted charts on paper you might be used to seeing x = 0 and y = 0 in the centre.
